Weather radars do not only detect precipitation, but also birds in the sky. By extracting these bird detections, researchers can study their movements. This is especially useful for studying songbird migration, which takes place at night. On this website you can explore and download these data for a selection of European radars (i.e. the [BALTRAD dataset]({{ '/baltrad/' | relative_url }})) and access other related resources such as [file formats]({{ '/vpts-csv/' | relative_url }}) and [other datasets]({{ '/datasets/' | relative_url }}).
